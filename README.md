# QFC - Quantized Fourier Compression of Timeseries Data with Application to Electrophysiology

## Overview

With the increasing sizes of data for extracellular electrophysiology, it is crucial to develop efficient methods for compressing multi-channel time series data. While lossless methods are desirable for perfectly preserving the original signal, the compression ratios for these methods usually range only from 2-4x. What is needed are ratios on the order of 10-30x, leading us to consider lossy methods.

Here, we implement a simple lossy compression method, inspired by the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the quantization steps of JPEG compression for images. The method comprises the following steps:
* Compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the time series data in the time domain.
* Quantize the Fourier coefficients to achieve a target entropy (the entropy determines the theoretically achievable compression ratio). This is done by multiplying by a normalization factor and then rounding to the nearest integer.
* Compress the reduced-entropy quantized Fourier coefficients using zlib or zstd (other methods could be used instead).

To decompress:
* Decompress the quantized Fourier coefficients.
* Divide by the normalization factor.
* Compute the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) to obtain the reconstructed time series data.

This method is particularly well-suited for data that has been bandpass-filtered, as the suppressed Fourier coefficients yield an especially low entropy of the quantized signal.

For a comparison of various lossy and lossless compression schemes, see [Compression strategies for large-scale electrophysiology data, Buccino et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.22.541700v2.full.pdf).

    num_samples = int(sampling_frequency * duration)
    y = np.random.randn(num_samples, num_channels) * 50
    y = lowpass_filter(y, sampling_frequency, 6000)
    y = np.ascontiguousarray(y)  # compressor requires C-order arrays

## Benchmarks

I have put together some preliminary systematic benchmarks on real and synthetic data. See [./benchmarks](./benchmarks) and [./benchmarks/results](./benchmarks/results).

As can be seen:
- Quantizing in the Fourier domain (QFC) is a lot better than quantizing in the time domain (call it QTC) for real data or for bandpass-filtered data.
- The compression ratio is a lot better for bandpass-filtered data compared with unfiltered raw.
- For the lossless part of the method, zstd is better than zlib, both in terms of all three of these factors: compression ratio, compression speed, and decompression speed.
- Obviously, the compression ratio is going to depend heavily on the target residual std. dev.
